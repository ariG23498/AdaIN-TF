# AdaIN-TF
Minimal Implementation of [AdaIN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868) with TensorFlow.

## Architecture

The architecture of the model is simple, it consists of the following parts:
- Encoder: Pretrianed VGG19
- AdaIN Layer
- Decoder: The generator that produces the stylised images
- Loss_Net: Pretrained VGG19.

## Dataset
The dataset used here is taken from the Kaggle Competition [Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself](https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started).
They provide preprocessed `tfrecords` for us to use TPUs for faster training. In the notebook present I have indeed used TPUs to train the model.

## Inference
